#Description
This project applies Jaa Script concepts to undertake the tasts

#Project SetUp

Steps
1. Create a repository on gitHub
2. Clone the repo in the terminal
3. Open the Vs Code and install necssary dependancies i.e prompt sync
4. Use node <filename> to run the code challenges

#Challenge1
This program will prompt the user to input student marks in range of 0-100. Once the user inputs the marks, the program should output the correct grade as per the following criteria 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 49 to 59, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

#Challenge2
This program will tell users the different speeds and whether there is a demerit point for a certain speed or not. For every 5km above the speed limit, the program will return a point and if points accumulate to 12 or more, the program will return "licence suspended"

#Challenge3
This program will allow the user to input any gross salary amount and calculate the deductions in terms of payee, NHIF and NSSF. It will also output the net pay after all deductions are made from the gross salary.
